= How to contribute to Decidim

We're really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us in https://gitter.im/decidim/decidim[Gitter]. We want you working on things you're excited about.

== Did you find a bug?

* *Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in Decidim*, and instead send us an email to security [at] decidim.org. See xref:SECURITY.adoc[full security policy].
* *Ensure the bug was not already reported* by searching on GitHub under https://github.com/decidim/decidim/issues[Issues] and on https://meta.decidim.org/processes/bug-report/f/210/proposals[Metadecidim].
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, https://meta.decidim.org/processes/bug-report/f/210/proposals/new[open a new one on Metadecidim]. Be sure to include a *title and clear description*, as much relevant information as possible, and a *code sample* or an *executable test case* demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

== Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

== Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

. Suggest your change in https://meta.decidim.barcelona/processes/roadmap[Metadecidim]
. Wait until Product Team reviews and accept the feature, as it's important to be consistent with the rest of the software, comply with the Social Contract, etc.
. Then you can make the Pull Request. If you make the PR without Product Team approval then you could get rejected (after investing lots of time on developing).
